# Beats School
## Hack@Brown 2021
---
An online, intuitive music-making software, dedicated to promoting individuality and the sharing of ideas through music.

When reflecting on the theme of the competition, our team, composed of Brown University freshmen Arvind Sridhar and Nick Masi, and rising MIT freshman Lucien Gaitskell, immediately reflected on how music has always served as a release from school. Whether it was chill music that calmed us down when driving back from school, or energetic hip hop music that drove us in the gym, music was a staple of the after-school experience.

Our project, Beats School, is meant to do exactly that - it's meant to beat school. Using music as a collaborative tool through which random users can work together to express their identities and create unlimited combinations of different types of beats, Beats School is meant to be the ultimate musical social zone-out from the seemingly 24/7 nature of school.

Our project overcame obstacles in the formation process, mainly in working with web audio frameworks. Javascript and react were relatively unfamiliar to our team, and the music library we used was generally old and unmaintained. However, even within the confines of the time limit, we were able to create a functional demo that fully and thoroughly addresses any issues that came up in the development process. Our team gained significant experience in working with music software development, understanding and properly manipulating libraries, and generally increasing experience with both react and javascript.
